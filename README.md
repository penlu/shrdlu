SHRDLU
------

This is a minimally modified version of Terry Winograd's SHRDLU code from 1972.

You can try to run this by executing clisp or some equivalent in the code directory, then attempting (load "init").
Expect errors! This code is from 1972.

Current line of work:
- reimplement FEXPRs using a well-worded macro
